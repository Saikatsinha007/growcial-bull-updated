I had tried many other courses but this course helped me to technically analyse the data and charts.<br /> Along with that, the live sessions were awesome and it even helped me to easily understand the various concepts of the Stock market which should be known. It even helped me analyse my results and the practice sessions were a lot helpful. Now I have started my Stock market journey yet again but this time with a lot of knowledge which will help me in right trading. There were many courses which I tried earlier but they focused just on learning. This course is a lot different as it focused on analysis and practical data through which I was able to analyse the results. If you want to start with the Stock Market, I would strongly recommend this course to you.",
