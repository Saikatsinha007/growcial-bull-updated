                Understanding Technical Analysis
            </h2>
            <p className='text-xl'>
                Technical analysis relies on the assumption that historical price and volume data can be used to predict future price movements. It's based on the idea that market trends tend to repeat themselves, and by studying past trends, we can gain insights into future ones.
            </p>
            <p className='text-xl mt-3'>
                The basic premise of technical analysis is that the market is made up of buyers and sellers who are constantly competing against each other. By studying market data, we can identify patterns that reflect this competition, such as trends, support and resistance levels, and chart patterns.
