                What is Swing Trading?
            </h1>

            <p className="text-xl">
                Swing trading is a trading style that involves holding positions for several days to several weeks. It's a more relaxed style of trading that allows traders to take advantage of larger market movements. Swing traders typically use technical analysis to identify trends and patterns in the market and make trading decisions based on that data.
