                    <span className='font-bold'>Use Stop Loss Orders</span> <br /> A stop-loss order is an order placed with a broker to sell a security when it reaches a certain price. It's a simple and effective way to limit your potential losses in case the market moves against you. By setting a stop loss order, you can exit a trade automatically if the price reaches a predetermined level. This can help you avoid emotional decision-making and limit your losses.

                    <span className='font-bold'>Diversify Your Portfolio</span> <br /> Another way to manage your trading risks is to diversify your portfolio. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Instead, spread your investments across different markets, asset classes, and trading strategies. This can help reduce your exposure to any one particular risk factor. Diversification can also help you take advantage of different market conditions and opportunities.

                    <span className='font-bold'>Manage Your Position Sizes</span> <br /> It's essential to manage your position sizes when trading. Don't risk more than you can afford to lose on any single trade. A good rule of thumb is to risk no more than 2% of your account balance on any trade. This means that even if the trade goes against you, you won't lose too much. Managing your position sizes can help you avoid catastrophic losses and preserve your trading capital.
                </li>
                <li className='mt-5'>
                    <span className='font-bold'>Keep a Trading Journal</span> <br /> Keeping a trading journal is a great way to manage your risks. Write down your trading plans, your reasons for entering a trade, and your exit strategies. This can help you stay disciplined and avoid emotional decision-making. It can also help you identify patterns in your trading behavior and make adjustments accordingly.
                </li>
                <li className='mt-5'>
                    <span className='font-bold'>Stay Informed</span> <br /> Staying informed is critical when trading. Keep up to date with market news, economic data, and other relevant information. This can help you make informed trading decisions and avoid unnecessary risks. It's also essential to keep an eye on your trading positions and monitor any changes in market conditions that may affect them.
