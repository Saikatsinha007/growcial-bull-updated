                Mistake #1: Not Having a Plan
            </h2>
            <p className='text-xl'>
                One of the biggest mistakes new traders make is not having a plan. They jump into the market without a clear idea of what they want to achieve or how they're going to achieve it. This can lead to impulsive decisions, emotional trading, and ultimately, losses. To avoid this mistake, you need to create a trading plan. Your plan should include your goals, your strategy, and your risk management techniques. It should also include rules for when to enter and exit trades, how much you're willing to risk on each trade, and how you'll handle unexpected events.

                Mistake #2: Overtrading

            </h2>
            <p className='text-xl'>
                Overtrading is another common mistake that can lead to losses. This is when you make too many trades in a short period of time, either because you're chasing profits or because you're trying to recover losses. To avoid overtrading, you need to have discipline and stick to your plan. Don't let your emotions drive your decisions, and don't make trades just for the sake of trading. Remember, quality over quantity.

                Mistake #3: Failing to Use Stop Losses
            </h2>
            <p className='text-xl'>
                Stop losses are an essential risk management tool that can help you limit your losses. A stop loss is an order to sell a security when it reaches a certain price. This means that if the price of the security drops below a certain point, you'll automatically sell it and limit your losses. Failing to use stop losses is a common mistake that can be costly. Without stop losses, you risk losing more than you can afford. Make sure to set your stop loss orders when you enter a trade and adjust them as the market moves.

            <h2 className='text-3xl font-semibold mt-4'>
                Mistake #4: Ignoring Fundamental Analysis
            </h2>
            <p className='text-xl'>
                Fundamental analysis is the study of economic and financial data to evaluate the intrinsic value of a security. It's an essential tool for long-term investors, but it's also important for traders. Ignoring fundamental analysis is a mistake because it can lead to mispricing of securities. When you understand the underlying factors that drive a security's value, you can make more informed trading decisions.
            </p>


            <h2 className='text-3xl font-semibold mt-4'>
                Mistake #5: Following the Crowd
            </h2>
            <p className='text-xl'>
                Finally, following the crowd is a common mistake that can lead to losses. When everyone is buying a particular security, it's tempting to jump on the bandwagon and do the same. But this can lead to overvalued securities and eventually a market correction.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl">
                To avoid this mistake, you need to do your own research and analysis. Don't rely on tips from friends or social media influencers. Make your decisions based on your own knowledge and experience.
            </p>

                Conclusion
            </h2>

            <p className="text-xl">
                Trading can be a lucrative and exciting activity, but it's also risky. By avoiding these common trading mistakes and following a solid plan, you can minimise your losses and increase your chances of success. Remember, trading is a marathon, not a sprint.
